# InstantConnection

During this hackaton, our idea was to build a tinder-job alike where you could swipe people based on their job title and qualifications.
For this project we used the following technologies : HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Angular, Mongo , Express, Node and Nodemailer.

Project was deployed on Heroku : https://hackaton01.herokuapp.com
